## About Me ##

After several years of working in the most ordinary office on the most ordinary operations, I realized that it is rather boring, dulling and generally not for me. Therefore, now I am in an active search for myself and my vocation. I am ready for new challenges and discoveries, I am actively interested in IT. Although the latter is given to me with a creak.
